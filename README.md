# PyBrowser
A python3 version of a web browser, which opens, searches, and more into a browser of your choice.

# What the Py-script can do
PyBrowser can do numerous amounts of work in your browser. It can search up a webpage (wow!), search google, and many more things!

# Commands
Type "cmds" to see the list of commands available.

# Compatability
This python script only works on Windows and Mac, due to the module in this script not working on different OS' such as linux.

This python script does not work on python 2, but only on python 3 due to some of the commands not existing or being changed in the two versions.
